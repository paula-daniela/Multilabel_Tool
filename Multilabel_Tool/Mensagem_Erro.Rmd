We were not able to create your model. Can you check some steps?

1. Check that your file was imported. (Click on the `Show Dataset` button). It must be in *comma-separated-values* or *csv* format.
2. Make sure that all the fields have been filled in.
3. Make sure that the selected **dependent** variable is different from the **independent** variables.

If after checking all this you still cannot generate your template, contact your application administrator.
