**Programming Language**

Multi-Label Classifiers Tool was developed using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language and the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) packages.

<br>


**Models**

The models available in this application were created using the [mlr](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/) package. This package provides several models and techniques commonly used in machine learning.


<br>


**Author**

The application was built by Paula, DP as an offshoot of the article "Prediction of multimorbidity using machine learning approach", written in partnership with Aguiar, OB, Marques LP, Bensenor I, Suemoto CK, Fonseca MJM and Griep RH <br>
